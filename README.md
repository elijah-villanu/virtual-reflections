# Virtual Reflections
Virtual Reflections is a personal virtual photography blog showcasing my in-game captures. Users may also create an account and interact with posts via likes, votes, and comments.

### Product Vision
For virtual photography enthusiasts or video game fans who want to connect to creator(s) directly in a blog style platform. The Virtual Reflections website is a personal virtual photography blog that showcases my (and other authors) in-game captures which allows users to interact with posts via likes, votes, and comments. Unlike Instagram of other platforms our Product has a larger focus on a collection of authors all in one place, creating a stronger knit community, while also going beyond virtual photography by holding discussions, game reviews, and individual game info (How Long to Beat, ect.)
